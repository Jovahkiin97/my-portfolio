                    <h1>My Past</h1>
                    <p>In 1997, born of a Navy vet and a college credited bookworm, I came out as a nonbinary artistic type with an analytical side. My sister arrived 4 years after me, then my brother 13 months after that. Starting out in Virginia, we moved pretty much every 5 years or less since I was born. Sometimes to different cities, sometimes to different states, and one time even to a different country. After spending my entire life constantly adapting to new environments, people, and experiences, I’m looking to build assets that provide stability. In accidentally adopting the voyager spirit of my father, I now want to create a way to generate income anywhere, as long as I have a laptop.

                    <h1>My Present</h1>
                    <p>Recent heartbreak and a desperate desire for change in my life brought me to coding. I've grown to realize that every facet of modern life includes some form of software based technology so I wanted an in to an industry that will not only be financially fulfilling, but also scratch an intellectual itch that I’ve always had as an artist. In my personal life I pride myself on my creativity. I play bass, produce, sing, and write; I also dabble in tattoo design and painting. When I’m not howling at the moon, I enjoy calisthenics, anime, video games, reading, skateboarding, rock climbing, and spending time with my cat, Seven.

                    <h1>My Future</h1>
                    <p>I hope that my newfound coding skills will intertwine with my art to help me prosper in both areas in the digital age. I ideally want to make music, movies, and videogames; A life not limited by simply one medium of creation. Since magic doesn’t exist (yet), tech is my best bet for bridging the gap between myself and my dreams. 
                        I’d love to create an app that guides cannabis users to products optimized to their needs, among many other brewing ideas.
                        I have 4 years and 9 months to make the Forbes 30 under 30 list and the clock stops for no one!
